Obstacle Detection and Dynamic Path Planning for Autonomous Off Road Navigation

**#Heatmap bumpy stitched.mp4**

We stitched together around 180 images to get a heatmap of our bumpy road simulation. The composes video shows the bumpiness the vehicle encounters. The orange denotes rough terrain, blue is the sky

So we tried to pre process the heat map image and get the program to detect the yellow path which is the best route, free from most rough terrain. We still quite haven't reached the RL part of the code but we are looking at using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) model.
